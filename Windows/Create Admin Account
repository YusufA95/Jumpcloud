Get-LocalUser


-------------------------------------

This PowerShell script appears to be performing several tasks related to managing local users and groups on a Windows system. Let's break down each part of the script:

Variable Initialization:

$admin_user and $admin_pass: These variables store the username and password of the admin account.
$admin_pass_secure: This variable is used to store the secure version of the admin password.
$group: It retrieves information about a specific group (Administrators group in this case) on the local system.
$admin_group: It stores the name of the local administrators group.
Checking for Admin User and Admin Group:

$checkForAdminUser: It checks if the admin user exists on the local system.
$checkForAdminGroup: It checks if the admin user is a member of the local administrators group.
Admin User Check:

If the admin user doesn't exist, it creates the user using net user command.
If the admin user exists, it ensures that the correct password is set using Set-LocalUser command.
Admin Group Check:

If the admin user is not a member of the local administrators group, it adds the user to the group using net localgroup command.
Renaming Local User:

It renames a local user account to match a user in JumpCloud (an identity and access management platform). However, the variables $local_user_to_rename and $local_user_jumpcloud are not defined in the provided script.
Get Overview of Local Users:

It retrieves an overview of local users using Get-LocalUser command.
