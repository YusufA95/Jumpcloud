-------

To put it simply. You may have changed the display name in Jumpcloud. If you also want to make them automatically local hostname, this code will be useful for you.

Install NuGet Package Provider:
The script attempts to install the NuGet package provider with a minimum version of 2.8.5.201 using the Install-PackageProvider cmdlet. This provider is often used for package management in PowerShell.

Check for Module Installation:
It checks if a module named "JumpCloud" is installed. This is done using the Get-Module cmdlet with the -ListAvailable parameter to list available modules.

Install JumpCloud Module (if not already installed):
If the "JumpCloud" module is not found, the script proceeds to install it using the Install-Module cmdlet with the -Name parameter set to "JumpCloud". It installs the module with the -Force parameter to suppress any confirmation prompts and installs it for the current user only (-Scope CurrentUser).

Wait for Module to Load:
After installation, it waits for the module to load by repeatedly checking if the module is available using Get-Module. This is done in a loop with Start-Sleep cmdlet to wait for one second between each check.

Print Installation Status:
Once the module is loaded, it prints a message indicating that the "JumpCloud" module has been installed. If the module was already installed, it prints a message stating that it's already installed.

Get Serial Number of BIOS:
It retrieves the serial number of the system BIOS using the Get-WmiObject cmdlet targeting the Win32_BIOS class. The serial number is stored in the variable $seriNo.

Connect to JumpCloud Online:
It connects to JumpCloud Online using the Connect-JCOnline cmdlet. The command is attempting to connect with a specific identifier ("b014b3ec37a92b7cf9573fa9e3b4cca9a5b36e92"), which might be an API key or another form of identification.

Retrieve New Hostname from JumpCloud:
It retrieves the new hostname from JumpCloud using the serial number obtained earlier. It fetches the display name of the system associated with the provided serial number.

Rename Computer:
Finally, it renames the computer to the new hostname obtained from JumpCloud using the Rename-Computer cmdlet. The -NewName parameter is set to the new hostname, and -Force is used to suppress any prompts.
